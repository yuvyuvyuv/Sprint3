That's how I lived on my own, without a person to help me, with whom I could talk properly, and that's how the days passed for me until my plane was hit by an accident in the Sahara desert. This happened six years ago and this is the crux of the matter: my aero engine broke down and since I had no driver or passengers with me, I tried to walk I learned the difficult craft of repair myself. It was a matter of life or death for me, because the amount of water I had was not enough for a week.

The first night I fell asleep on the sand in a remote place about a thousand miles away from settlement areas. I was more lonely than a ship whose ship was wrecked in the heart of the sea and he was carried on a raft. Therefore you can imagine how much I was surprised when I heard a thin and strange voice that woke me up from my sleep at dawn. And so the voice said:

- Oh... draw me a sheep!

â€“ What?!

- Draw me a sheep, please!

I got up from my place like thunder. I looked this way and that, and here in front of me was a lovable and very strange sleeper, who looked at me with a heavy head. And it is the most successful portrait that I have painted over time. Except that these drawings are not as spectacular as the figure of the little man standing before me. And it is not my fault. As a kid, the adults let go of my hands when I was six years old and I gave up on the art of painting and I didn't learn to draw anything like snakes-bolts from outside and from the inside.

With eyes filled with tears, I looked at the strange figure that appeared before me. Please don't forget that at that very hour I was in the heart of a desert, at a distance of a thousand miles from any place of return. And despite all this, the little barnacle was not seen as lost in finding a way, nor as fainting from exhaustion or hunger, thirst or fear. His sight was nothing like the sight of a child lost in the heart of the wilderness, at a distance of a thousand miles from any settlement.

When my hand finally came up to take a sentence out of my mouth I asked in bewilderment:

- What are you doing in this place?

However, he calmly returned his request as he was talking about a very respectable matter:

- Come on... draw me a sheep!..

When we stand before a great mystery, we dare not show reluctance. With all the irony in the matter - that after all, I had been wearing it for an hour at a distance of a thousand miles from any place that would return and expected the danger of death - I took out of my pocket a piece of paper and t originates. However, I remembered that most of my time was devoted mainly to studying geography, the words of the sea, calculation and accuracy; That's why I told the guy (with a bit of irritation) that I don't know how to draw. So he answered and said:

- It's alright. Draw me a sheep!

I have never drawn sheep, so I returned to one of the two drawings that I had in my hand, it is the drawing of the snake escaping from the inside. To the rabbi's curiosity, the boy said:

- no and no! I don't want an elephant inside a rattlesnake. The escaping snake is a dangerous creature and the elephant is heavy and burdensome. And for them everything is very small. I need a sheep, draw me a sheep!

I created.

He looked at the painting with a heart and the city:

- No! This sheep looks very sick. Draw me another sheep.

I drew again.

His friends smiled happily and said with forgiveness:

- Your eyes see because this is not a sheep. This is a deer. It has horns...


I went back and drew again, but even this drawing did not really set his mind like the previous drawings.

- This sheep is too old - he said - my desire is a sheep that will last for days.

- My patience has run out, because I wanted to start first by disassembling the engine. That's why I drew this drawing with rough lines and said:

- This is Teva. The sheep you want is found inside the box. - To my surprise, the young visitor's face lit up and he exclaimed with joy:

- Finally, you have made my wish! Do you think that this sheep needs a lot of grass?

- Why do you ask this?

- because with me everything is very small...

- The grass will definitely be enough for her - I said - after all, I gave you a tiny sheep.

He bowed his head above the painting and said:

- She's not that small... Look, she fell asleep!...

And that's how I got to know the little prince.
